# MEAN Stack Application 

This is an application I built using MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, Angular and NodeJs. This app is a small example of what kinds of things you can build using the MEAN stack. I decided to build this app in an effort to teach myself AngularJS as well as brush upon my skills on the backend using NodeJS.


There is not data in the MongoDB database-- this was purely to see how to set up a MEAN stack application and work with AngularJS for the first time.
